    	<h2>Quality</h2>
		<p>"The [Dart] has appeared in publications and was mentioned by Councilman Brian Leeper in an award presentation Tuesday night attended by a large crowd including people sporting Park Center Automotive t-shirts. He received a standing ovation..."</p>
        <p> "I have called them just to get quotes on items and they are always much more reasonable than other shops. It is so refreshing to finally have a local autoshop I can depend on for high quality repairs at a reasonable price."</p>

		<h2>Commitment</h2>
		<p>"Ford has owned and operated Park Center Automotive—just a stone's throw away from city hall—for more than two decades." </p>
        <p> "You'll find this business is fully staffed with trained and experienced professionals who want your business and for you to leave a satisfied customer."</p>
        <p>"They are extremely honest, trustworthy, and reasonable. I highly recommend them for car and truck repairs." </p>
</div>
	<div id="tbox3">
		<h2>Integrity</h2>
        <p>"They've always been honest and strive to satisfy the customer. They do what's needed and nothing more." </p>
		<p>"They have saved us a lot of money over the years by being reasonable and honest about the repairs needed on our vehicles."</p>
        <p>"You cannot ask more of a couple guys than to be honest, friendly, courteous and just plain stand-up men!"</p>

        <p>"Our car battery died while we were preparing to go to PA for a funeral. They came to where we were stranded (after hours), jumped the car, and then told us to bring it immediately back to the shop for a new battery. </p>
        <p>This was all after 6:00 in the evening! They had us on our way the next morning, first thing! We were able to get to the funeral home early for my brother's viewing. They will never know how much I appreciate and cherish them."</p>
